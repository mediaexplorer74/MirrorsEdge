TEXT_220	All the news you need	
TEXT_221	Inquiry calls for crackdown on Runners	
TEXT_222	An official inquiry has called for the immediate introduction of tougher measures to curb the illegal activities of Runners; highly athletic couriers specializing in the commercial distribution of illegal materials.||The inquiry, which involved the collaboration of national intelligence and municipal authorities, brings to light disturbing new information on the extent of the Runner's criminal activities. In addition to working for organized crime, the Runners have now been proven to have possible links to notorious terrorist cells rumored to be embedded in the city.||Speaking at a campaign fundraiser, Senator Elaine Callaghan stated, "Public perception of Runners as harmless low rent pests and thrill seekers has been shattered today. Our efforts must be vigilant in striking down this threat to our city as we move ever closer to peace". Callaghan lamented the lack of co-operation from police in the inquiry as, "regrettable" and called for, "a re-evaluation of the city's obviously inadequate data retrieval facilities and the extension of the Guardian surveillance network to marginalized areas".      	
TEXT_223	Pirate Radio Transmission	
TEXT_224	The Voice of Defiance	
TEXT_225	“Would be Mayor, Elaine Callaghan, is peddling her usual shtick today through one of her loyal digital media mouthpieces, The Daily City, as she blazes along the campaign trail to her vision of a sparkling, high-rise utopia free of grime, grit and humanity.||Her latest scapegoat? Our faithful Runners; that stalwart, final bastion of freedom of information in a world where every bowel movement is monitored.||Citing results of a completely fabricated inquiry into Runner activities, Callaghan now claims that if we don't stop the Runners, the terrorists win. Look, so what if the Runners have some shady clients? The truth is they are all that hold us; the disenfranchised, the disbelieving, the disheveled, together.||If you need to get a message to someone without the Guardian network playing peeping Tom, then you need a Runner. Fact is; they are the single remaining method of private untraceable communication in the entire city. Hell, even the CPF have been known to have a few on the payroll. But hypocrisy from the cops isn't something to be surprised about in this town, is it?”	
TEXT_226	Intercepted CPF Communication 	
TEXT_227	“Alright, listen up. We just got a lock on another pirate transmission operation; Runner sympathizers.||Now you all know we're getting heat from the press lately. It doesn't help that Callaghan's gunning for us because I wouldn't hand over our Runner informants for that stitch-up "inquiry" she's running, either. Any more speeches from her like yesterday and we'll all be night guards at Eden Mall. If we do this up right then she might ease off.||I want every officer on the scene immediately. Get in there, shut the broadcast down and arrest all civilians found. We'll be taking a chopper to see if we can pick up any stragglers. Good luck out there; your jobs might count on it.”	
TEXT_228	“Thanks to a timely warning from our new friend, Faith, the operators of this esteemed broadcast narrowly avoided violent reprisal at the hands of CPF today and are free to pollute the airwaves another day.||So, chalk another one up to the Runners; apart from providing the best damn rooftop acrobatics delivery service you'll never see they also moonlight as protectors of the city's only source of unadulterated news.||For such a nice bunch of people it makes you wonder about reports we're getting about escalating animosity between rival Runner groups over clients and delivery routes. Word is, some are stooping to sabotage, as ramps and planks used for rooftop trade routes are being moved or destroyed, resulting in potentially fatal falls for Runners that don’t look before they leap. C'mon people, it's dangerous enough out there without someone moving your plank.”	
TEXT_229	Public outcry against CPF incompetence	
TEXT_230	There was public outcry today against police as it was revealed that innocent lives could have been saved in the attack on a Megacomplex development site last December had police acted earlier on known information.||In what Senator Callaghan described as, "Unforgivable gross negligence", the department failed to sufficiently investigate an anonymous tip that could have led to an arrest prior to the explosion at the developing Megacomplex site that claimed the lives of twenty seven construction workers.||Called on for comment at the opening of a new children's hospital wing, Callaghan further opined, "As we again grieve for the heroes that died that tragic day we must now also grieve for the loss of what should be our civic right; a competent police force".||News of the bureaucratic bungle comes fresh on reports that police botched a routine raid just hours ago and failed to apprehend a lone Runner despite several weapons being discharged. 	
TEXT_231	“This is bad. Callaghan isn’t going to stop until she has her own private army. She’s going to bury us and at this rate she’s going to do it with the city’s blessing.||I know we’ve had arrangements with Runners in the past; no doubt they serve a purpose, but from here out, all bets are off. We need the people back on our side and if that means we have to hang a few Roof Rats out to dry then so be it.||We've had reports of a possible Runner enclave hiding out in an empty office building on City Road. If there's any Runner activity I want to know about it. We need to make some arrests and get a press release out as soon as they're processed.”	
TEXT_232	Three dead in bomb attack	
TEXT_233	A man has been arrested after a bomb detonated prematurely inside the loading docks of the city’s almost completed Eastern Megacomplex development; killing three and injuring five in a grim reminder of last year’s similar attack on a Megacomplex development.||Matt Cotton has been identified as a member of an organized gang of Runners and is suspected of involvement in several past attacks against the city. He is being held at the city police department pending trial. Armoured CPF task forces are being deployed in response to the attack.	
TEXT_234	Callaghan demands tougher security measures	
TEXT_235	Senator Elaine Callaghan again rallied for tougher security measures at a campaign fundraiser today. She claimed today’s Megacomplex attack was, “entirely preventable”, and called for, “increased public surveillance, a tougher, smarter law enforcement presence and a focus on punitive deterrence measures on the streets as well as in the courtroom”.	
TEXT_236	“We are receiving a number of reports with more information regarding the audacious attack against the CPF holding cells as we go to air. It is true that the CBD police station is being stormed by an armed group but, contrary to what the Daily City is reporting, these people are not Runners.||Several reliable sources inform us that this is a rogue group with absolutely no connection to the Runner community. Apparently they have stormed the holding cells and are using C4 to break everyone out.||With news yesterday of our favourite Runner’s capture by the CPF we hope that at least some good can come from this callous attack on the station. If she can get out, we’re sure Faith will be a great asset in tracking down this rogue group and clearing the Runner’s names.”	
TEXT_237	Public opinion paves the way for PK	
TEXT_238	The city is primed for an unprecedented overhaul of its law enforcement infrastructure in the wake of more public disgrace to the police department as they fail to prevent an all out attack on the city station at the hands of the Runners.||As constituents continue to lose faith in the department, calls are being made for the Chief of Police to step down and a solution for the growing fear and violence in the city to be found. Senator Callaghan believes she may have that solution in a radical proposal brought forward today which would see police relegated to revenue generating infringement notice enforcement and the introduction of private, highly trained and equipped militarized personnel, under contract from Pirandello Kruger, to handle security concerns.||Polling indicates a growing wave of support for Callaghan and her proposed amendments.	
TEXT_239	“Officer Kate Connors has received intelligence about a suspected attack on New Stream Energy today.||Her source says an isolated Runner gang is being employed to carry out the attacks to discredit us.||We can’t take any risks, though. This might be our last chance to put things right. Get to New Stream and seal it off. If you see a Runner, kill them. As far as I’m concerned they’re all in on it.”	
TEXT_240	New Stream Energy completes expansion	
TEXT_241	Privatized utility company New Stream Energy is now the sole provider of recycled water resources to the entire city. New Stream has recently completed work on centralizing all of the city’s water resources, encompassing residential, commercial and industrial services.	
TEXT_242	Chemicals stolen from University labs	
TEXT_243	A large quantity of 14-azacamptothecin, a potent water-soluble poison, has been reported stolen from the City University medical centre today. Apart from use in pharmaceutical research, the hazardous chemical has a number of industrial applications.||University Professor, Jarrad Trudgen, expressed bafflement as to why anyone would steal such a large amount of the highly toxic substance unless for, "nefarious purposes".	
TEXT_244	“We are hearing from the wider Runner community that they definitely do not have anything to do with the recent Megacomplex attacks being pinned on them. We have it in good faith from a most trusted source that the maniacs responsible are hired guns masquerading as Runners.||One theory has it that PK mercs are actually behind the attacks to create a false demand for their services. Unfortunately, the CPF seem oblivious to any of this and are indiscriminately hunting down anyone in a pair of running shoes.||Please, if any CPF officers are listening, think about who you’re shooting at. The Runners might just be your biggest allies in the days ahead.”	
TEXT_245	Malfunction at New Stream	
TEXT_246	An unpredictable technical fault has resulted in the water supply to huge sections of the city being completely shut off.||New Stream Energy spokesperson, Angela Lin, stated that the problem will be remedied as soon as possible and urged people to remain calm.	
TEXT_247	Hospitalized Runner threatens to sue	
TEXT_248	A man hospitalized for injuries sustained while trespassing on CBD rooftops is threatening to sue the city for failing to provide proper signage for hazardous obstacles.||Jonathan Derby, a confessed Runner, stated that construction equipment on a popular Runner trade route nicknamed, “the Suez Canal”, was frequently moved and caused Runners to make potentially fatal misjudgments on their runs.||Judge Steven Moore stated that the case, “is a joke; a waste of the court’s and the taxpayer’s time”. He added, “In no way have any of the municipal construction by-laws been violated”.||Mr. Derby is expected to be charged and sentenced later today.	
TEXT_249	“Word has it that our good friend, the elusive Faith, has single-handedly prevented the latest in a string of homicidal attacks against the city’s people.||In a plan as insidious as it would have been deadly the entire city’s water supply was to be contaminated with a potentially lethal chemical. And behind it all? Why, our city’s glorious benefactors.||It would seem that these ongoing attacks and the resultant tide of public disdain for the police has been carefully orchestrated by the powers that be in an effort to discredit the CPF and justify the removal of any remaining civil liberties we have left.||We just hope it’s not too late to change the people’s minds that replacing the police with paid mercenaries is a bad idea. Very bad.||Oh, and if anyone can bring the leader of this rogue group responsible for Callaghan's dirty work down... well, I guess we just gotta have Faith.”	
TEXT_250	FROM THE DESK OF ELAINE CALLAGHAN	
TEXT_251	RE: Project Icarus	
TEXT_252	Please confirm reservations for tomorrow’s lunch with PK’s CEO. Despite the setbacks we still have enough steam to get this deal through.||Oh, and send a gift basket to the Chief of Police with my regards. Something for his retirement.||Also, have all necessary arrangements made for C’s meeting with Pope. Everyone’s priority should now be on executing Project Icarus.

## Tech. details
- App type: UWP
- Win SDK build: 19041
- Min. Win SDK build: 10240

## Status
- Work-in-progress
- Draft UWP app as result of initial reversed-code research (early bird -- not for game run!)
- Min. Win. SDK = 10240, and Win. SDK 19041 used
- Alpha state, 100500 bugs still here (but binary game data not decoded, and screen scaling problems not fixed)
- Music theme refresh (StillAlive-2025 based on Mirror's Edge - Still Alive-1 by Cookieluver31)
- No Russian (ru) text support (sprite font problem?), only English (en) text resource seems to be ok... 

## ToDo
- Fix sounds&music... no sound is not good :)
- Fix bugs to normal game run
- Extend Input manager (kbd, mouse, and touchscreen or joystick)
- Fix localization
- Fix screen scaling
- Check game data & settings save/store
